To install:

Run:

 make
 make install

To run:

 findenc
 htmlenc

findenc and htmlenc both can take a switch of either "-e" or "-c" to search the episode list or chronology sections respectively.
you can also pass a search string on the command line.
eg:
  findenc -e emissary

If you want a list of what photos are related, use "-m", eg:
  findenc -m kirk
(it assumes your cd is mounted at '/cdrom' but its not important)

If you use '-ec', the episode list will be sorted by series and episode #.

Passing '-u' to either findenc or htmlenc will remove accented characters from the output (e.g. for piping to 'less').

That's about it.

You need to either be in a directory with a data file (see below) or
set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable.
eg in sh/bash/etc:
 export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
or in csh/tcsh/etc:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt
(suiting filenames to match :)

--Data files--
 Data.cxt
 eg_tng.dxr
 eg_ds9.dxr
 omni1.dxr
 omni_v2.dxr
 data99.cxt


just set the ENCY_FILENAME variable to one of these, eg:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/tng_ep/eg_tng.dxr
(if you are using csh, tcsh, etc.)

If you use the eg_tng.dxr or eg_ds9.dxr (episode guide) files, you will need to look in the EPISODES section, ie:
  findenc -e emissary
or:
  htmlenc -e yesterday

--REMEMBER--
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY:
dont forget - if you can't get it to work, dont hesitate to mail me.

--NOTE--
If you are planning on using the pictures with the TNG or DS9 episode guides, be warned that you will need to mount the cd's with the option 'unhide'

ie (as root):
  mount -o unhide /dev/cdrom /cdrom

or in your fstab:
  /dev/cdrom   /cdrom   defaults,noauto,ro,unhide  0 0

Also, the videos for these aren't yet supported by xanim (AFAIK).
