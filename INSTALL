To install:

Run:

 make
 make install

To run:

 findenc
 htmlenc

findenc and htmlenc both can take a switch of either "-e" or "-c" to search the episode list or chronology sections respectively.
you can also pass a search string on the command line.
eg:
  findenc -e emissary

If you want a list of what photos are related, use "-m", eg:
  findenc -m kirk
(it assumes your cd is mounted at '/cdrom' but its not important)

That's about it.

You need to either be in a directory with a data file (see below) or
set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable.
eg in sh/bash/etc:
 export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
or in csh/tcsh/etc:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt
(suiting filenames to match :)

--Data files--
 Data.cxt
 eg_tng.dxr
 eg_ds9.dxr
 omni1.dxr
 omni_v2.dxr

just set the ENCY_FILENAME variable to one of these, eg:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/tng_ep/eg_tng.dxr
(if you are using csh, tcsh, etc.)

If you use the eg_tng.dxr or eg_ds9.dxr (episode guide) files, you will need to look in the ENCYCLOPEDIA section, ie:
  findenc emissary
or:
  htmlenc yesterday

--Unknown files--
With ency 0.7.10 on, unknown files with a file format similar to the ones used here can be opened. The file in question is usually the biggest one on the CD/whatever, often in the root directory of the CD. They usually have extentions like ".cxt" or ".dxr".

To see if your 'unknown file' would work, run 'scanenc' over it:
  scanenc /dose/trek/Reference/Data.cxt
You would probably want to look at it through 'less':
  scanenc /dose/trek/Reference/Data.cxt | less

You should (after a while) see a list of entry titles, along with their position in the file. If this appears to work, do this:

1) Set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable to the name of your file.
    eg in sh/bash/etc:
      export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
    or in csh/tcsh/etc:
      setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt

2) use the '-u' argument with findenc or htmlenc
    eg
      findenc -u kirk
      htmlenc -u picard

Note though that all entries are in the 'Encylopedia' section, regardless of where they belong.

--NOTE--
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY:
dont forget - if you can't get it to work, dont hesitate to mail me.

--NOTE--
If you are planning on using the pictures with the TNG or DS9 episode guides, be warned that you will need to mount the cd's with the option 'unhide'

ie (as root):
  mount -o unhide /dev/cdrom /cdrom

or in your fstab:
  /dev/cdrom   /cdrom   defaults,noauto,ro,unhide  0 0

Also, the videos for these aren't yet supported by xanim (AFAIK).
