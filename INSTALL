To install:

Run:

 make
 make install

To run:

 findenc
 htmlenc
 showm

That's about it.
You need to either be in a directory with the Data.cxt file (case sensitive) or
set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable.
eg in sh/bash/etc:
 export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
or in csh/tcsh/etc:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt
(suiting filenames to match :)

Other files to look for:
 eg_tng.dxr
 eg_ds9.dxr
 omni1.dxr
 omni_v2.dxr

just set the ENCY_FILENAME variable to one of these, eg:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/tng_ep/eg_tng.dxr
if you are using (t)csh

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY:
dont forget - if you can't get it to work, dont hesitate to mail me.
