To install:

Run:

 make
 make install

To run:

 findenc
 htmlenc

findenc and htmlenc both can take a switch of either "-e" or "-c" to search the episode list or chronology sections respectively.
you can also pass a search string on the command line.
eg:
  findenc -e emissary

That's about it.

You need to either be in a directory with a data file (see below) or
set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable.
eg in sh/bash/etc:
 export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
or in csh/tcsh/etc:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt
(suiting filenames to match :)

--Data files--
 eg_tng.dxr
 eg_ds9.dxr
 omni1.dxr
 omni_v2.dxr

just set the ENCY_FILENAME variable to one of these, eg:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/tng_ep/eg_tng.dxr
if you are using (t)csh

If you use the eg_tng.dxr or eg_ds9.dxr (episode guide) files, you will need to look in the EPISODE section, ie:
  findenc -e emissary
or:
  htmlenc -e yesterday

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY:
dont forget - if you can't get it to work, dont hesitate to mail me.
