To install:

Run:

 make

Copy or move the findenc & htmlenc files to the install directory.

To run:

 findenc
 htmlenc

That's about it.
You need to either be in a directory with the Data.cxt file (case sensitive) or
set the ENCY_FILENAME environment variable.
eg in sh/bash/etc:
 export ENCY_FILENAME=/dose/ency98/Data.cxt
or in csh/tcsh/etc:
 setenv ENCY_FILENAME /dose/ency98/Data.cxt
(suiting filenames to match :)
