Technicalish info.
------------------

Data.cxt holds all of the text, etc.
Each section (not necessarily in alphabetical order!) starts off with a header, saying:
	-startword
	-words
	-bold or italic
the title is included in the word count.

it then has the title, text, and (a) a 0x00 byte or (b) two '\n's and a 0x7E (~)

it then continues.

all this starts at the 506921st byte.

ill get around to documenting more after ive had some sleep and some coffee.

mibus.
