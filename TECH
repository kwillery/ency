Technicalish info.
------------------

Data.cxt holds all of the text, etc.
Each section (not necessarily in alphabetical order!) starts off with a header, saying:
	-startword
	-words
	-bold or italic
the title is included in the word count.

it then has the title, text, and two ascii 13 characters

it then continues.

all this starts at the 506921st byte.

ill get around to documenting more after ive had some sleep and some coffee.

mibus.
