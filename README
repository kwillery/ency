Mibus's Ency Reader '98.
------------------------

For the Star Trek Encyclopedia. The '98 one. With ST:FC etc...

(So called because it is mine (Robert Mibus), it reads an "Ency"clopedia, and it reads the '98 version.)

Installation
------------
Uhhh... 
Compile. Run. Behold.

That's about it.

The More Technical Thingys
--------------------------
I am (slowly) implementing a set of functions to do stuff in the encyclopedia, so anyone can write a small app to do ency stuff. findenc.c is my sample.
For info on how my program works, read the source.
