The More Technical Thingys
--------------------------
I am implementing a set of functions to do stuff in the encyclopedias etc., so anyone can write a small app to do ency stuff. htmlenc, findenc, and showm are my examples.

For info on how my program works, read the encyfuncs.c file. to use the api, read README.API
